    <h2>README</h2>
    <p>welcome to LyricsLive, this program works with the spotify desktop app to give better lyrics support,</p>
    <h2>Windows Guide</h2>

    <p>download the script below</p>
    <p><a href="main.exe">windows download</a></p>
    <p>once that script is running ensure that spotify is on</p>
    <p>when all of that is done open <a href="model.html">this link</a></p>
    <br>
    <p>if the website shows "undefined" check that the main.exe script is both running and not showing any errors, to tell if there are errors check the text on the main.exe script window, if there is any point where the word "error" is found then try to open the spotify app and selet the "x" instead of the "-" button, for this to work you need to have "minimise on close" on in spotifys preferences.</p>
    <br>
    <h2>Linux Guide</h2>
    <p>download the script below</p>
    <p><a href="main_linux.py">linux download ( dbus )</a></p>
    <p>ensure that python is installed</p>
    <p>ensure that all the modules used in the main_linux.py file are installed either in the same venv as the script or globaly, to install packages globally  use <code>--break-system-packages</code> at the end of the pip install command</p>
    <p>after all of that is done, and working go to <a href="model.html"> this link</a>.</p>
    <p>this program is not in any way associated with the offical spotify company</p>
