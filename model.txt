[Intro]
 Go!

[Verse 1]
Stapled shut,
inside an outside world,
and I'm Sealed in tight,
bizarre but right at home 
I'm claustrophobic,
closing in 
And I'm catastrophic,
not again I'm smeared across the page and doused in gasoline I wear you like a stain, yet
I'm the one who's obscene Catch me up on all your sordid little insurrections
I've got no time to lose,
I'm just caught up in all the cattle

[Pre- Chorus]
Fray the strings
Throw the shapes
Hold your breath Listen!

[Chorus]
I am a world before
I am a man 
I was a creature before 
I could stand 
I will remember before 
I forget Before I forget that!

I am a world before 
I am a man 
I was a creature before 
I could stand 
I will remember before 
I forget Before 
I forget that!
